What is this?
====================
This is a sample website that I'll more than likely use to experiment or as a framework, I am also testing out how markdown works. 

[What is Markdown?](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) 
--------------------
Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid HTML. Thus, “Markdown” is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax; and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to HTML. See the [Syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) page for details pertaining to Markdown’s formatting syntax. You can try it out, right now, using the online [Dingus](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus). **It is also what is used in this README file**

--------------------
This page offers a brief overview of what it’s like to use Markdown. The syntax page provides complete, detailed documentation for every feature, but Markdown should be very easy to pick up simply by looking at a few examples of it in action. The examples on this page are written in a before/after style, showing example syntax and the HTML output produced by Markdown.
